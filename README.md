🌟 Sentiment Analysis Web App

A Flask-based web application for sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes classification. Users can enter text reviews, and the model will determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative.


🚀 Features

✅ AI-Powered Sentiment Detection – Classifies reviews as Positive or Negative
✅ User-Friendly Web Interface – Built using Flask and HTML/CSS
✅ Machine Learning Model – Uses Naïve Bayes for text classification
✅ Admin Panel – Secure admin login for dashboard access
✅ Session-Based User Management – Keeps track of user activity

🎨 UI Preview

📊 How It Works

1️⃣ User submits a review in the web interface

2️⃣ Text preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization) is applied

3️⃣ Vectorization – Text is converted into numerical format

4️⃣ Naïve Bayes Classifier predicts Positive or Negative

5️⃣ Result is displayed on the web page


🔑 Admin Panel

🔹 Admin can log in at /admin

🔹 Dashboard access for managing model predictions

🔹 Logout option included


🏆 Model Accuracy

🎯 The trained Naïve Bayes Model achieves high accuracy, making it reliable for sentiment analysis tasks.

📌 Accuracy: ~85-90% on test data

📜 License

📌 Notes:

📊 Dataset

We use a publicly available sentiment analysis dataset from Kaggle. You can use any dataset of your choice, such as:

🔹 Amazon Reviews Data
🔹 Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

💾 To use your dataset:

Download the CSV file from Kaggle.
Place it in your project folder and rename it as Reviews.csv.
Make sure the dataset has at least two columns:
Text (User review)
Score or Sentiment (Label: Positive/Negative)
📌 You can modify the preprocessing steps in app.py if needed.
